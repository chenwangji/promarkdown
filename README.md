# ProMarkdown

** Just initialized. Come back in a week **

A professional grade markdown editor for React, based on CodeMirror.

It provides professional grade editing functions for coders and tech-writers:

- Key map, vim / sublime / emacs
- Line numbers
- Search and replace
- Block folding
- YAML frontmatter, the one feature motivates us to develop this component
